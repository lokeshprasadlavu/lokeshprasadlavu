## 🔍 About Me

I'm a data enthusiast with a passion for turning complex datasets into clear, actionable insights. With 3 years of experience at Cognizant in API-driven environments and current graduate studies in Business Analytics at Montclair State University (GPA: 4.0), I blend practical industry knowledge with a strong academic foundation.

### 🧠 I Specialize In:

- 📊 **Data Analytics & Visualization**: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), KPI design, statistical modeling, and visual storytelling using Python and Tableau
- 📈 **Machine Learning Fundamentals**: Regression modeling, feature engineering, and performance evaluation for forecasting and prediction tasks
- ⚙️ **Backend Architecture & Microservices**: Building RESTful APIs using Java (Spring Boot), applying service discovery, circuit breakers, and asynchronous messaging
- 🗄️ **Databases & Storage**: Experience with **MySQL** and **H2** for relational data modeling, persistence, and integration within microservices architecture 
- 🔄 **Resilience & Scalability**: Load balancing, Hystrix fault tolerance, Kafka-based decoupled communication, and configuration centralization via Spring Cloud
- 🧪 **Testing & Optimization**: API testing (Postman), performance tuning (JMeter), and writing efficient, maintainable code

- ⚖️ Optimized request handling and scalability with **Spring Cloud Gateway** **load balancing** across microservices
- 📬 Leveraged **Apache Kafka** to build asynchronous, event-driven pipelines for high-volume data ingestion
- 🧪 Validated all API endpoints and data exchanges using **Postman** to ensure accuracy and performance under load

#### 🚲 [Capital Bikeshare Data Analysis](https://github.com/lokeshlavu01/Capital-Bikeshare-Data-Analysis)
Performed an end-to-end exploratory and predictive data analysis project on **16 million+ ride records** to uncover behavioral trends, forecast demand, and support data-driven decision-making.

- 📊 Performed in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) on 16M+ ride records using Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- 🧼 Cleaned, transformed, and standardized data to resolve missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies
- 📅 Engineered time-based features (hour, weekday, season) to analyze behavioral trends in ridership
- 🔍 Uncovered actionable insights around peak usage periods, user segmentation, and weather influence
- 📈 Built a regression model (R² = 0.69) to forecast ride volume, supporting demand planning and resource allocation
- 📌 Defined and tracked key KPIs:
    - Total Rides
    - Peak Hour
    - Average Trip Duration
    - Top Stations
- 📊 Created interactive Tableau dashboards to visualize usage patterns, seasonality, and demand hotspots, leveraging Google BigQuery as the data source
- 🧾 Combined statistical modeling and storytelling to communicate data-driven recommendations
- 🧪 Executed end-to-end analysis in Jupyter Notebook and Tableau, showcasing hybrid technical proficiency
- 💡 Strengthened skills in data storytelling, business insight generation, and stakeholder reporting
